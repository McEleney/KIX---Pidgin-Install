This is a KIXtart LOGIN (not startup!) script that will:
* Check to see if Pidgin is installed and install it silently if it is not.
* If the installed version of Pidgin is outdated by the install file, silently upgrade.
* Check to see if any accounts are configured and copy in a custom user accounts.xml file if there
  are not.
* Install the spellcheck dictionaries.
* Add a startup link.

It won't:
* Launch Pidgin on the same boot that it gets installed (unless the script finishes up before 
  explorer.exe launches). Launching it from the script under Vista/7 would give it privileges Pidgin
  doesn't need and might introduce unwanted complications like reading from the wrong profile. It 
  will, however, create a desktop shortcut so the user can launch it immediately.
* Create accounts on the Jabber server. You must create them in advance. See the section on 
  passwords below.

ORIGIN

We set up an internal Jabber server to add another method of communication between employees, and
I needed an easy way to get Pidgin onto all computers with a custom accounts.xml file for each 
user. 

REQS

* Windows XP/Vista/7 in an AD environment.
* User accounts set up with proper first and last names. If you use some other format for names 
  you'll probably need to edit the script a bit, since it relies on @FULLNAME returning "Firstname 
  Lastname".
* Install file for Pidgin 2.7.0 or higher (http://www.pidgin.im/).
* Working Jabber/XMPP server with accounts and passwords preconfigured (I've only tested ejabberd).
* KIXtart executibles (http://www.kixtart.org/) and preferably an existing KIX login script.

USAGE

Grab Pidgin's install file (or the offline installer that includes GTK) and put it in a network 
location users can reach. Place all the files and folders here in that same location. The KIX script
itself can be located anywhere; given that (as written) it generates user passwords internally 
(see PASSWORDS) you probably don't want it somewhere where users can see it. 

Place the certificate for your Jabber server in certificates\x509\tls_peers.  

Pidgin 2.7.0 and up uses dictionary files from OpenOffice. Grab the spellcheck dictionary files 
from here: 
http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/openoffice/contrib/dictionaries/

You want <your language code>.zip. For example, US English is en_US.zip. Extract these files into
the dict directory. 

Now, edit install_pidgin.kix and change the appropriate variables as instructed in the comments.

Test the script on a workstation by running KIX32 install_pidgin.kix. 

If it works, then call install_pidgin.kix from your existing kix script, or add a link to it 
in your GPO.

PASSWORDS

The script generates passwords from the last name of the current user, substituting the 
following...
a=4
e=3
i=1
o=0
u=7
...and appending 1 to the end. 
Bob Johnson's password would be J0hns0n1. 
Dave Engle's password would Engl31 (remember, the substitution is case-insensitive).
Secure? No way. IM is not and is not intended to be secure communication.
